            <img src="assets/images/pelicanfiller.png" id="about-image" class="clearfix" alt="In case anyone wonders, this is a photo of a pelican I took at Rocky Point in July. It has nothing to do with the content, but I wanted a quick and easy filler that was more original than a gray box and hey, there it was. Plus, I already had it on my computer, and all the other vacation photos had me or my fiance making dumb faces so there you go."/>
            <p>I’m a developer-in-training and recent graduate of the University of Arizona,
                where I earned two very pragmatic and highly career-focused degrees in philosophy
                and linguistics, which are actually super interesting and relevant to- wait,
                where are you going?</p>
            <p>I have far too many hobbies to list here. My meta-hobbies include: researching
                new hobbies, quickly discarding new hobbies should I not find them enjoyable
                (fail quickly!), and purchasing books on my existing hobbies so that visitors
                to my apartment can see how serious and scholarly I am.</p>
            <p>Writing code began as yet another fleeting interest, but by virtue of the
                incredible depth and breadth of knowledge to acquire and the impressive amount
                of money waiting for those who acquire it, I’ve found more than enough to keep
                me in it for the long haul. It felt like magic, at first, to draw back the
                curtains on the machines that have run my life since I was old enough to operate
                a keyboard and finding something so complex, so messy, and so beautiful—then I
                realized I could conjure the stuff myself, and I was hooked.</p>
